# ASTEROIDS

### This is asteroids in python using pygame.

This project was built to learn more about classes and inheritance in python. This was harder than expected in some parts and the oppisite in others. I am not sure if I will add polish to this or not.

If you want to try it out feel free to clone the repo. You will need to install everything via the requirements file. I built this on WSL2 and had no issue getting pygame to run properly. However, you may need to install [VcXsrv](https://vcxsrv.com/) in order for it to work properly.
